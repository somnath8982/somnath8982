# About Me

I am a passionate and versatile programmer with a strong foundation in multiple programming languages, including **Java**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **C**, **C++**, and **C#**. My curiosity drives me to explore and experiment with newer languages like **Rust** and **Go**, broadening my technical horizons. Among all the languages, **Java** holds a special place as my favorite.

I have honed my skills in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** through rigorous practice in both **Java** and **C**, equipping me with a deep understanding of efficient coding and problem-solving techniques.

Currently, I am a dedicated student at **AMC Engineering College**, where I continue to expand my knowledge and work on projects that challenge me to grow as a developer. I'm eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities that align with my passion for technology and innovation.
